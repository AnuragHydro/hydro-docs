# Hydro Snowflake Whitepaper
This is the whitepaper outlining our Snowflake Identity Protocol. We believe that this open framework protocol will create a stardard in the decentralized identity space that will allow for open and closed projects to easily access user data in a decentralized manner.

This is currently a DRAFT of the paper and many things will likely change. We would love to community members to comment on typos/ideas/insights into what we have.
